## Devops References

A bunch of reference files from popular DevOps tools I use frequently, following the principles of *IaC* (Infrastructure as Code), *GitOps* (Single source of truth) and automation.

- Docker: Containerization
- Kubernetes: Orchestration
- Terraform: Provisioning
- Ansible: Configuration
- Vagrant: Virtualization
